        <p>I played Counter-Strike since 2004 started with 1.6 and CSS and I was extremely addicted.<br> Going to school jiggle peeking in the hallways to avoid teachers I hated and always quick <br> switching with my pencils and erasers. I remember back in
          elementary school I use to bhop <br>during hopscotch because that was big in early CSS days before zblock was added. Once I <br> go home I would play instantly and went straight to to bed without noticing I skipped dinner.<br> Is this just me or anyone
          else
          addicted like me? :/ </p>
